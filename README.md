## About

EMI BBL Compat is a compatibility mod that integrates the BBL (BenBenLaw) mod series with EMI (Extended Mod Integration), providing recipe viewing support for BBL mods without requiring users to install every single BBL mod.

## Features

### BBL Strainers Integration
- ✅ Full EMI recipe display for strainer recipes
- ✅ Shows mesh requirements, input items, and required blocks/fluids above the strainer
- ✅ Displays all possible outputs with their chances and amounts
- ✅ Dynamic recipe height to accommodate multiple outputs
- ✅ Separate recipes for each specific input (e.g., different leaf types show their unique outputs)
